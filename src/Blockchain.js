                            Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs
                            from a typical database in the way that it stores
                            information; blockchains store data in blocks that
                            are then linked together via cryptography. As new
                            data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block.
                            Once the block is filled with data, it is chained
                            onto the previous block, which makes the data
                            chained together in chronological order. Different
                            types of information can be stored on a blockchain,
                            but the most common use so far has been as a ledger
                            for transactions. In Bitcoin's case, blockchain is
                            used in a decentralized way so that no single person
                            or group has controlâ€”rather, all users collectively
                            retain control. Decentralized blockchains are
                            immutable, which means that the data entered is
                            irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that
                            transactions are permanently recorded and viewable
                            to anyone.
